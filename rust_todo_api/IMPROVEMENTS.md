Use this as a living checklist of ideas to add later.

- Input validation (email format, password length, empty title checks)
- Better error handling (custom error type + JSON errors)
- Migrations with `sqlx::migrate!`
- Refresh tokens (access token + refresh token flow)
- Pagination + filters for `/todos`
- Role-based access (admin/user)
- Tests (unit + integration)
